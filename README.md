## UPDATE LOG

**2022.09.10**   
1. create Github depository   
2. support DC/DC step down resistor calculating    
3. support parallel resistor calculating   

## WHAT IS IT FOR

When designing PCB schematic diagram, I feel it is a waste of time that calculating resistors' value under kinds of scenarios. So I made this tool.   


## HOW TO USE

1. compile `res-tool.c` rough gcc or other compiler   
2. run the executable file   
      1. os is windows, run `.\res-tool -h` to check help menu   
      2. os is linux, run `./res-tool -h` to check help menu   
3. find all information about this tool in help menu
